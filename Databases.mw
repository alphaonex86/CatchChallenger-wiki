= Access =
What server kind need what database:
* Login server need: login (read in all case, if account automatic creation then read/write), common (all)
* Master server need: login (read if account automatic creation), base, common (all, read)
* Game server need: base (read), common (spec), server

= Requirements =
With the actual database structure (version 2, commit: 085281a66ce52232782a0f56e2339fa7070a350c), the requirements are:
* Search by primary key
* Search by index on single colomn
* Search by index on multiple colomn
* Able to store int, string, blobs
Preferred:
* Able to work without primary key
* Able to store 8Bits and 16Bits int, string: fixed and variables size
Not required:
* Transactions (commit, rollback)
* Relational (Join, ...)
* Consistency (The master server lock the globale data linked to the account util the last write is done, then consistency done by the master server)
