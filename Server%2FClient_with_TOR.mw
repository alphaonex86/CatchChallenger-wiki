As usual, inform you about how TOR work. What can reveal your identity, ...

= Server =
== Protection ==
Mount your CatchChallenger TOR server under virtual machine '''on encrypted volume'''. To prevent direct access reveal you host an CatchChallenger server. That's mean, '''you can't start up automatically the server'''. You need start up manually and '''give the prompted password'''. Prevent physical access. Prevent bug or security break of your server. Grsec + Pax for linux kernel with option '''PAX_MEMORY_SANITIZE''' is good idea on host and guest.
== CatchChallenger ==
* Listen on 127.0.0.1 port 42495
* Auto-create account
== Tor ==
Into my /etc/tor/torrc I have:
<pre>User tor
PIDFile /var/run/tor/tor.pid
Log notice syslog
DataDirectory /var/lib/tor/data
HiddenServiceDir /home/tor/
HiddenServicePort 42489 127.0.0.1:42495
BandwidthRate 100 KB
ExitPolicy reject *:*
</pre>
With command:
<pre>mkdir -p /home/tor/
chown tor.tor /home/tor/</pre>
As well, prefer run CatchChallenger server into limited account. You public host is into '''/home/tor/hostname''' after start the tor service.
== Test ==
You can test it under linux with packet ''Torsocks'' and ''telnet'' by the command:
<pre>usewithtor telnet y1h7x768hq9nt5xs.onion 42489</pre>
Where '''y1h7x768hq9nt5xs.onion''' is get from your '''/home/tor/hostname'''

= Client =
After have started your tor proxy (Windows client you can use ''Vidalia'', settings -> sharing -> relay traffic for inside the Tor network, relay port: 9050, '''wait some time before try connecting to have good tor connexion'''), and configure the buyed and full client to use it (proxy 127.0.0.1 port 9050) and connect on '''y1h7x768hq9nt5xs.onion''' port '''42489'''. 

'''Don't forget buy the full client to fund the project and have client without crack and virus/trojan.'''
