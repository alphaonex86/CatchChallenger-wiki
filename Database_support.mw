Multiple database connector (mysql, sqlite, postgresql, ...) is supported or:

* Qt sync connector to be universal (SQLite is more to have single player mode)
* C custom connector to be optimized and asynchrone to never slow down if the database respond slowly, this is mostly based on epoll for linux

Not used into CatchChallenger:

* Relational SQL part:
** It will be better for good dev, but bad dev manipulate too much data to do stupid thinks
** More hard to read, understand
** CatchChallenger read and serialize/unserialise binary, why not do that's?
** Some engine/Database don't support it (MyISAM)
