= Hardware =
== Cpu ==
* Intel Atom should work
* Core2duo or more modern work
== Memory ==
* 32MB should work
* 128MB is optimal (depands on the datapack)
== Graphics card ==
* No graphics card required, because all the game run in software
* OpenGL 2 can be used to accelerate the render, but is optional

= Software =
== OS ==
* Windows since Windows 7, 32Bits or 64Bits (game in 32Bits)
* Linux
* Mac 10.8+

= Target =
Similar game worked on this hardware:
* CPU:	16.8 MHz 32-bit ARM7TDMI with embedded memory.
* Memory:	32 kilobyte + 96 kilobyte VRAM (internal to the CPU), 256 kilobyte DRAM (outside the CPU).
* Resolution:	240 Ã— 160 pixels (3:2 aspect ratio).
