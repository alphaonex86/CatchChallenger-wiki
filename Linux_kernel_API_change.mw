* Write one buffer into multiple FD, to do multicast at IP level without register and fixed group (because can change all the time)
* Pass the event AND datas into the program via epollWait to prevent buffer copy
* Fast path for write, need get the write buffer current cursor (lock), release returning the writed size. This is possible only in cooperative mode.
