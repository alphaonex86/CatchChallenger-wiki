= Introduction =
This can applied to all similar 2D tile game. Is very useful for the performance because it group some calculating and it limit the displayed players.
= Algorithm =
The player list of visibility is calculated as delayed of the move, instant for the insert/remove. To not reload all the distance list, keep all the list. Ignore very far player, and no store it.

The visibility distance is limited by maximum_distance_visibility and the number of player displayed.

For the local player only ('''all relative to the current player'''):
* Visible player list (player pointer + distance):
 while(visible list size < max_visible_player)
   add to visible list group by group, but to keep lower than max_visible_player
* maximum_distance_visibility: screen radius + number of step before calculation * (speed step * 2 -> opposed speed) * 1.5 (security)
== Distance calculation (step speed * 5) ==
Call at frequency of (step speed * 5), mainly 200ms * 5 = 1s.
 if(current map client > max_visible_player || (current map client + near map client) > max_visible_player)
   Calculate all new distances (group by distances), on current map, temporary list keep all lower than maximum_distance_visibility
 else
   Calculate all new distances (group by distances), on current map, temporary list keep all lower than maximum_distance_visibility
 Do the new Visible player list
 visibility limited = if have not displayed all the player;
 if (one entry is not into the previous list)
   send insert order
 if (one entry is not into the new list)
   send remove order

== Remove ==
 if(into visible list)
    Then send remove to player && remove from visible player list;
== Insert ==
 Calculate the distance
 if(distance > maximum_distance_visibility || (distance > more far group && visibility limited == true))
   return;
 if(visible player list size() +1 > max_visible_player)
 {
   remove the more far group and send remove order
   visibility limited = true;
   if(distance = more far group)
     return;
 }
 Insert into visible player list && send insert order

== Complexity ==
* To send the move: o(n^2), where n is visibility list size, then limited to max_visible_player
* Distance calculation (5s): o(n^2), where n is (visibility list size + not so far), then limited to max_visible_player
