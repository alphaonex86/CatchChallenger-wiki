== Datapack ==

To do the convertion from version 1 to version 2:
* move the map from map/ to: map/main/[name]/ that's allow common base with multiple server with different map
* sub change for monsters: if you have a file: map/main/[name]/city.xml you can create map/main/[name]/sub/[sub-name]/city.xml to have sub specific variation of server, the datapack and map is same, only the monsters/rates will change and is readed
* player/start.xml -> put id for each start, drop the map value, create the file: map/main/[name]/start.xml with content:
<pre>
<!--
/!\ warning, directly put this information into db
/!\ not check if x,y is into the range of the map
-->
<list>
    <start id="normal">
        <map x="10" y="10" file="maptest"/><!-- Searched into: map/main/[name]/maptest -->
    </start>
    <start id="test">
        <map x="10" y="10" file="maptest2"/><!-- Searched into: map/main/[name]/maptest2 -->
    </start>
</list>
</pre>
* Move map/conditions.xml to map/main/[name]/conditions.xml
* industries/ and map/main/[name]/industries/ have same content, both is merged, the second overwrite the first if same id
* Move quests/ to map/main/[name]/quests/
* Move shop/ to map/main/[name]/shop/
* Move zone/ to map/main/[name]/zone/
