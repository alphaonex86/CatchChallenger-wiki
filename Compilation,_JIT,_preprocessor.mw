= Compilation =
<blockquote>A compiler is a computer program (or a set of programs) that transforms source code written in a programming language (the source language) into another computer language (the target language), with the latter often having a binary form known as object code.[1] The most common reason for converting source code is to create an executable program.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The name "compiler" is primarily used for programs that translate source code from a high-level programming language to a lower level language (e.g., assembly language or machine code). If the compiled program can run on a computer whose CPU or operating system is different from the one on which the compiler runs, the compiler is known as a cross-compiler. More generally, compilers are a specific type of translator.</blockquote>

= JIT =
<blockquote>In computing, just-in-time (JIT) compilation, also known as dynamic translation, is compilation done during execution of a program – at run time – rather than prior to execution.[1] Most often this consists of translation to machine code, which is then executed directly, but can also refer to translation to another format.</blockquote>

What is the change against the compilation?
* Use all the instruction set of the cpu, allow usage of SIMD (MMX, SSE, AVX, ...) to improve the performance without change the code (as multi-thread programming)
* Take care of one time loaded variable:
  var toto=config[Toto]
  if(toto==X)
  do something
  else
  do another thing
The jit will detect that's and do:
  if(true)//the condition is always true/false
  do something
  else
  do another thing
And will optimise as:
  do something
