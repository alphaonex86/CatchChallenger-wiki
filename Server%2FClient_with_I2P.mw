As usual, inform you about how I2P work. What can reveal your identity, ...

= Server =
== Protection ==
Mount your CatchChallenger I2P server under virtual machine '''on encrypted volume'''. To prevent direct access reveal you host an CatchChallenger server. That's mean, '''you can't start up automatically the server'''. You need start up manually and '''give the prompted password'''. Prevent physical access. Prevent bug or security break of your server. Grsec + Pax for linux kernel with option '''PAX_MEMORY_SANITIZE''' is good idea on host and guest.
