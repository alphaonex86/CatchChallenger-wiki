Pass 100% of cpu -> 70% when I uncomment into the .pro file:
 QMAKE_CFLAGS="-pipe -march=native -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -floop-block -floop-interchange -fgraphite -funroll-loops"
 QMAKE_CXXFLAGS="-pipe -march=native -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -floop-block -floop-interchange -fgraphite -funroll-loops"
