Actual performance on '''19 April 2012''' is with benchmark of '''200''' with GUI:
* Ram used under linux: 22MB
* '''Cpu: 4%''' on core i5 750
* 11B/s in upload, 6KB/s in download

Actual performance on '''20 April 2012''' is with benchmark of '''400''' with GUI:
* Ram used under linux: 70MB
* '''Cpu: 20%''' on core i5 750
* 11B/s in upload, 12KB/s in download

Pass 100% of cpu -> 70% when I uncomment into the .pro file:
 QMAKE_CFLAGS="-pipe -march=native -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -floop-block -floop-interchange -fgraphite -funroll-loops"
 QMAKE_CXXFLAGS="-pipe -march=native -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -floop-block -floop-interchange -fgraphite -funroll-loops"

At '''200 player on the unique map''' with '''full visibility''', with move and few bit flooded chat, '''in debug''' (Qt and program):
* '''30B/s client''' -> server, 200KB/s server -> client (du to bad visiblity settings for the benchmark, '''100B/s server -> client with correct settings''')
* '''32% of cpu usage on quad core'''
Where is the cpu usage:
* 75% into ssl, maybe due to missing kernel crypto api
* 22% into the event parsing
* '''1% into the program'''
It use '''22MB of memory for all player''' ('''110KB by player''' including message decoding variable, ssl layer, ...) + 22MB as base, total = 44MB.

All is very fast and don't need greater server.
