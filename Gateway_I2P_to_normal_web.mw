Here the step to mount a gateway to expose via gateway a catchchallenger hosted on i2p to the normal web. Why do it with gateway?

* Optional: download the i2p site, rewrite the html file to hide the i2p url, and provide it via a http server
* Expose the i2p server to local 127.0.0.1:XXXXX standard tcp port into i2p pannel
* Restart the gateway and fill the xml file
* install a transparent socks redirector: redsocks, TranSocks, tranSOCKS_ev, tsocks, ...
