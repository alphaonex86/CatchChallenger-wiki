The server need be able to be splited and work as cluster, or work as one and unique server standalone.

As well, each step need user input like:
# Login/pass (Login server), with Character selection grouped by group of world (group of game server). Where the same character can evolve into a world and switch to another world (with same inventory, ...) (Characters server)
# Game server selection, where the world can be the same but is mostly different to change the user experience (Game server)

As well, if the point 2 is useless (only one Character or/and Game server), the selection is skipped, and the RTT is dropped.

To be more clear for the network, when the server is grouped, only one port is open. If you have the unique server for Login server, Characters server, Game server only one port is open. It's more easy to administrate. And skip inter-server communication and list of performance.

The game server connect to Login server (register on it). A unique key and login server id is passed to swith to the Game server. '''One server is a master''', game and login server is connected on it. It allow communication and lock the character played to prevent double usage.
