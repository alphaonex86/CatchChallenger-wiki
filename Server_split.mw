The server need be able to be splited and work as cluster, or work as one and unique server standalone.

As well, each step need user input like:
* Login/pass
* Character selection grouped by group of world (group of game server). Where the same character can evolve into a world and switch to another world (with same inventory, ...)
* Game server selection, where the world can be the same but is mostly different to change the user experience
