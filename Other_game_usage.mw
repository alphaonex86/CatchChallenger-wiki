* No tiled move (pixel move), to be more flexible
* Platform game, with gravity
* Enemy visible by multiple players

= How use it =
You can extract only the base folder into each folder. With that's you have:
* Chat
* Map (move on map, load it, colision, show the other player, ...)
* All the done by message and protocol, to be multiplayer game, MMO game, single player game. (Need be coded like server/client, same for single player game)
