Into the future version when this is stable is planned but with low priority without any donation to it:

= Features for other game =
* No tiled move (pixel move), to be more flexible
* Platform game, with gravity
* Enemy visible by multiple players

= How use it =
You can extract only the "base" folder into each folder into the sources. With that's you have:
* Chat
* Map (move on map, load it, colision, show the other player, ...)
* All the done by message and protocol, to be multiplayer game, MMO game, single player game. (Need be coded like server/client, same for single player game)
* Login for multi-player
Then you wish do a basic tiled game (like the retro game), from just the basis, you can re-use this base because is isolated.
