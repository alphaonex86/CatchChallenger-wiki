If your server is under DDOS, apply this rules:

= Limit the connect =
You need apply this firewall rules with iptable under linux to limit the connect on the server, only 1/10s by ip.

<pre>-A INPUT -m recent --name catchchallenger --rcheck --seconds 1 --hitcount 10 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 42489 -j DROP
-A INPUT -m recent --name catchchallenger --remove
-A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 42489 -m recent --name catchchallenger --set -j ACCEPT</pre>
= Why DDOS all server level? =
Because lower it's transport level. Only the server have the capacity to understand the message layer (how split and compose it) and then filter the message by seconds.

That's allow to split the different message type and apply different limit. The move on the map is more frequent than chat message, store on warehouse, ...
= Settings =
== General case ==
The settings to use:
* Customise your server login message to inform your user
* Use the visibility none, to limit the '''cpu and bandwith'''
* Disable all chat, to limit the '''cpu and bandwith'''
* Enable datapack cache, to limit the '''cpu and hdd''' usage
* Put the compression to none, to limit the '''cpu''' but '''grow the bandwith'''
* Use http datapack cache if you can, to limit the '''cpu, bandwith and hdd''' usage
* Disable ''Automatic account creation'' to prevent continuous more entry into the database, to limit the '''cpu, bandwith, space and hdd''' usage
* reemit: use '''more bandwidth''' because reemit the player move and '''improve the cpu''' performance because it send the same composed packet to all player

== Upload saturated ==
* All above
* Uncheck send player number
* Force the seed
* Don't send pseudo
* Enable zlib/xz compression if the usage cpu is low (<10%)
