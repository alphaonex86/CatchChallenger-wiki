[[File:human-map.png|Human visual representation of map group and split]]

Here you have a visual representation of map group and split.
* Group to do zone graphic, simplifie the computing
* Split the zone with different characteristic
* You have point into a zone to access to some target
* Some zone is fight zone where you need have the level but you can gain experience

I use a custom multi precision algorithm to resolv quickly the path, locally it resolv with the biggest zoom and max precision, and for far path is use simplified path with the lowest zoom and less precision. It's few bit as google map/open streat view, depanding of your level of zoom it load less or more detailed image.

[[File:schematic-view-bot-resolv.png|Schematic view for bot resolution]]

The bot need found:
* What is the accessible map
* What is the target
* The path and condition to access to each target
* Go to target

= Layer priority =
Here the most important to less, the most important information overwrite the less important:
* Not walkable
* Ledge
* Monster
* Walkable

This is exclusive, mean you can only have one type of above. Note Ledge and Monster implicate Walkable. Walkable mean not Ledge or Monster. And Monster implicate not Ledge and Walkable.

= Inteligencia artificial =
The Inteligencia artificial allow have better bot, able to learn, adapt it self to the game content

== Context datas ==
You need the client + common + server data. Mostly the accessible target determined above.

== Personality ==
The inteligencia need:
* a base personality (crafter, farmer, fighter, ...)
* a short and long term memory
* Random affect to item
** Affect to positive thing: when you have positive gain all the related item/place/target is detected and considered as more positive
** Item (will try few bit more to have it)
** Place (will try be more in this zone)
** Target (will try more this kind of target)
