Have fix url or access, included with change of internet provider, or have multiple internet connexion. This include for other service than http, like: mail (pop, smtp), irc, xmpp, ... Have access to site web via the normal web thanks to inproxy (XXXXXX.b32.i2p.us), and less sensible to dns or routing security leak.

Have decentralised service, with minimum latency, when you can't/wan't dynamic dns and ipv6. Or multiple same service on same port, on you network. You can route 2 server on port 80 without change on internet port or have reverse proxy (haproxy and i2p).
